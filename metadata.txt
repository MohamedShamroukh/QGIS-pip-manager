about=POI Visibility Network is a QGIS plug-in that constructs graphs (networks) of unobstructed lines of sight between two types of decision points during urban travel - junctions and turning points within the street network (SN), and origins and destinations of travel, i.e. points of interest (POI). POIs are locations designated as relevant for the analysis, i.e. buildings, entrances, land parcels, amenities, stations, and other. These are point-based, linear or polygon entities, as the user might wish to encode them in the input data. # Elaborate Description
